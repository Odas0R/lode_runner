# Lode Runner 🏃‍♂️

This game is just a simple version of [Lode Runner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lode_Runner)

I made this project for an assignment at College.

Since I've put many hours into this, I thought it would be a good idea
to make it open source.

It still needs some work, there's some bugs that I would like to fix.

## Test the game:

**I do not own this game**.
